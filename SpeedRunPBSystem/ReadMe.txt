Using Streamlabs Chatbot application, after connecting your twitch account along with a bot account, you can import this zip file to Scripts. 

Use: 

Message: !pb (GameTitle) 
Response:  Streamer's Name's PB in (GameTitle) is (Time) 

Message: !npb (GameTitle) (Time)
Response: Congrats on the new PB! Your PB for (GameTitle) is (Time)

In the GUI for the script you are able to initialize your PBs. Please enter them in a format of (GameTitle1) (Time1) (GameTitle2) (Time2) ...
After hitting save settings this should update your PBs. You may have to hit the refresh button on the scripts page and then click save again
for the changes to take affect. Also, if you change anything else in the GUI all setting will be updated so if you have an incorrect PB in the 
textBox your PBs will be changed to those values.
